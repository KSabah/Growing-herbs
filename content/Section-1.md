## Soil

Soil refers to the medium in which your plants will grow. Many herbs thrive in different kinds of soil, but all the herbs chosen for this tutorial enjoy a similar type of soil. For the purpose of this tutorial, you will be modifying ordinary potting soil to suit the needs of your herbs. 

## Light

All plants need light and when growing plants indoors, one of the biggest challenges that gardeners face is the amount of light that they can provide. Most herbs prefer a lot of sunlight, especially those that originate from a Mediterranean climate, like Basil. This guide assumes you are availing of natural sunlight. 

## Water

The amount of water, the frequency of watering, and the method of watering can all have an impact on how well your plants grow. There are several methods of delivering water to your plants, but you will be using a watering can for your initial sprouts, and then bottom watering by placing your plants in a container of water when they are more established. 

## Fertiliser 

Herbs are not voracious feeders, so they do not require too much fertilisation. However, since your plants are being grown indoors in containers, they will benefit from a feeding of fertiliser every now and then. This will be discussed in more detail in a later section. 

## Pruning

Pruning refers to cutting parts off the plant in order to encourage it to grow back fuller and bushier. Not only that, but pruning extends the life of the plant further into the growing season. Herbs in containers will require pruning to keep them compact and to encourage them to continue to grow.
